# Customer Data Cleaning & Analysis Project 📊

This project focuses on **Data Preprocessing** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a customer dataset containing inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. The goal is to clean the data and extract meaningful insights.

## 🚀 Features
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and removing duplicates.
* **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and managing extreme values in income and purchase frequency.
* **EDA:** Visualizing distributions and relationships between features.
* **Visualizations:** Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for data storytelling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## 📁 Project Structure
1.  **Environment Setup:** Importing necessary libraries.
2.  **Data Loading:** Reading the "fake_customer_data_with_errors.csv".
3.  **Data Exploration:** Checking types, nulls, and basic statistics.
4.  **Cleaning:** Dropping unnecessary columns (like 'ID') and handling missing data.
5.  **Visualization:** Plotting income distributions and purchase patterns.

## 📈 Key Insights
* Analyzed the distribution of customer **Income**.
* Explored the relationship between **Age** and **Purchase Frequency**.
* Identified high-value customer segments.

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the dataset `fake_customer_data_with_errors.csv` in the same directory.
3. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or VS Code.
